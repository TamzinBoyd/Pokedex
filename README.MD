BRIEF

Set myself the challenge of creating a random Pokemon generator using a public API as we had recently learnt how to access public rest APIs.

APPROACH

1. Did a fetch request to pokeapi.co
2. Used documentation and support of other sites to discover how to drill through the object to access desired values.
3. Once I found how to access the Pokemon based on an ID I needed a way to make this random. I set the ID within the object to generate a random number, so each time the page loads this changes.
4. Added a click event to the button to reload the page and generate a random Pokemon each click.
5. Added simple styling using official Pokemon colours.
